<br>
<p>As you notice there is  bower.json file that contains all dependencies that can be installed by <b>bower install</b> command, however I deploied the app with dependencies allready installed (see dBlogApp/bower_components) </p>
<p><h4>!! No need to install dependencies !!</h4></p>
<br>
<p>The app itself represent a Blog App, that require further development (at this stage the app is at the development stage)</p>
<p>There is no server side of the application yet</p>
